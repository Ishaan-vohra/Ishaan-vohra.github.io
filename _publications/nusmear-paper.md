Complete Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of a neutrino experiment typically involves the lengthy and CPU-intensive process of integrating models of incoming neutrino fluxes, event generation, and detector setup. We describe a fast, geometry-independent, GENIE-based system known as NuSmear which provides preliminary simulation of energy smearing and angular smearing for neutrino-nucleon interactions. We discuss NuSmear's simulation methodology, explaining its calculation of reconstructed values through its model-based resolution computation, smearing distributions, and particle detection dependencies. We go on to validate NuSmear's performance as a fast simulation system through a series of internal and external comparisons testing its predictive accuracy and model-adherence. Finally, we briefly explore the potential for future user-customization in NuSmear.
