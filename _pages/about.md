Hi, I'm Ishaan. I'm an undergraduate student at MIT studying Physics and Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS). I conduct research in optical computing and silicon photonics for AI hardware in the [Quantum Photonics and AI Group](https://qp.mit.edu/) led by Prof. Dirk Englund at [MIT RLE](https://www.rle.mit.edu/).

I have previously worked on nano-electronic neural interfaces in the MIT Media Lab, building on my background in computational nuclear and particle physics at CERN, Fermilab, RIKEN, and the University of Liverpool. Beyond research and engineering, I [compose, mix, and master electronic music](https://www.youtube.com/@eleronmusic), and enjoy playing badminton on the MIT club team.

I'm on a mission (or at least a well-intentioned attempt) to do my part for the advancement of civilization, applying scientific principles to create large-scale impact.
