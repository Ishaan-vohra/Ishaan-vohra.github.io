- *Project goal/objective:* Computationally optimize the underground location for the upcoming Modern Modular Bubble Chamber (MMBC) auxiliary neutrino detector based on off-axis neutrino flux calculations.
- *Technologies used:* C++ (code), Geant4 (neutrino flux and interaction simulations), Python (code).
- *Deliverables:* GitHub repo consisting of flux optimization calculations.
