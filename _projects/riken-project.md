- *Project goal/objective:* Analyze nuclear reactions both in simulation and experimentally with a pelletron accelerator, and compare the reaction rates (total and angular differential cross sections) to existing theoretical predictions, as well as perform error analysis.
- *Technologies used:* keV-MeV range pelletron accelerator (experiment), Geant4 (light-matter interaction simulations), Python (data analysis).
- *Deliverables:* Presentation given before 2023 Riken Nishina School workshop.
