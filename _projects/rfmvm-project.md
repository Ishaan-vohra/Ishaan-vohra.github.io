- *Project goal/objective:* Proof of concept for matrix-vector multiplication (linear analog computing) in the RF domain in a highly compact and cost-efficient setup, useful for applications in low-latency signal processing.
- *Technologies used:* Keysight ADS (RF PCB design), TXLine (RF PCB design), CNC milling machine (PCB fabrication), soldering under microscope.
- *Deliverables:* Fabricated hardware matrix-vector multiplier, presentation given before RF/photonics industry judges.
- *Other notes:* This presentation opened up the possibility of a 2025 summer research internship at [Analog Photonics](https://www.analogphotonics.com/home/) for my team and I! Unfortunately I already had committed to another project in MIT RLE's [Quantum Photonics and AI Group](https://qp.mit.edu/), so I couldn't pursue the opportunity further.
